TODO: - Allow users to enter more than one character if they've figured out the secret word or part of secret word.
        Multiple characters entered at once MUST follow the same sequence as that of the secret word (or part of the
        secret word) whether there are blanks/underscores in the word progress or not, for the guess to be valid, otherwise
        the guess will not be valid. For example:
            Secret_word = 'vacation'    guess = 'ion'       // VALID because the characters in the guess follow same sequence as part of the Secret word
            Secret_word = 'vacation'    guess = 'action'    // INVALID because 'a' is missing between 'c' and 't' in the guess
            Secret_word = 'topmost'    guess = 'most'       word_progress = '____os_'   // VALID because the guess sequence is same as secret_word
                                                                                           even though 'os' had already been guessed in word_progress.
            Secret_word = 'topmost'    guess = 'mt'         word_progress = '____os_'   // INVALID because the guess excludes 'os' from the secret_word
                                                                                           even though 'os' had already been guessed in word_progress.
      - Game commands will now have to be prefixed with an exclamation mark (!) to distinguish them from multiple
        character entries. For example:
            `!q` to Quit the game
            `!w` to Generate a new Secret Word
            `!h` to Show the Help Message
            `!s` to Reveal the Secret Word
