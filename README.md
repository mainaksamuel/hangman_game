# hangman_game
Hangman Game implemented in Python

This was just a fun project I did in my new learning journey into programming.

#### Game Start
A welcome message will be displayed and a Secret word will be generated.
Enter single characters at the prompt to guess the Secret Word in order to win.

#### Revealing the Secret Word 
Enter `sw` at the prompt and confirm with `y` to **_Show the Secret Word_**.
An option will appear to either `Quit` the game or start a `New Game` after revealing the Secret Word.
